  @file AutoTrains.script
  @author Brett Stawinski

  Creates the AutoTrain and AutoVehicle objects for a session. This allows us
  to add any number properties required for sim properties, and also lets us add
  some constants to the objects, representing immutable properties (e.g. the
  maximum speed for each train type).  No control should be done here.
  It should be in the auto_train_control.script
