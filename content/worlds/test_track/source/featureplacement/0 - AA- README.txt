Track Features Status
=====================

The new Feature Placement Tool Chain.

Notes:

Each world will have its own copy of the featureplacement directory. 
i.e. if there is a test world it no longer gets piled into here, it has its own directory under the worlds directory

Tracks are now placed in worlds/worldname/definition - Both Base Track and Populated Tracks.

Features are NOT sorted out yet - I have no idea how we are going to manage a bunch of Core features as well as project specific ones.

This is not set in stone - changes will probably be made but this is enough to get started with placement.
