# Enable enhanced touch capturing.
#
# The GMI does not natively support touch input.
# Most modern touchscreen drivers do not synthesize a mouse press 
# until some other action has occurred (move or release).
# This will result in momentary controls not responding if the user presses 
# the screen without moving their finger.
#
# This flag will place a (virtually) transparent window in front of the application which 
# captures and forwards mouse and touch inputs in a momentary control-friendly way.
#
# Note that this capturing window may cause other applications to seemingly ignore input,
# which may be confusing for anyone using this computer for anything other than this application.
