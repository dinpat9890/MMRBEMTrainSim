# This section contains generic configuration for recording and previewing
# media.
[Media Recorder]
# Unique Name is an optional string, used to identify the recordings from this
# module. It is only necessary when there is more than one instance of this
# module in a system, and those modules are associated with the same hub;
# otherwise it may be safely omitted. If unspecified, the default is an empty
# string.
Unique Name=fstds_cctv

# !! THE CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION ONLY SUPPORTS ONE *OR* FOUR SOURCES !!
# Default Sources is an optional comma-delimited string, containing the
# unique names of the media sources that this module will display. These must
# match the Unique Name property for the media sources, specified elsewhere
# in this file.
#
# An empty string may be used to indicate a blank source (e.g. feed0, ,feed1
# would display the feed0 source, a blank source, then feed1). If unspecified,
# the default is an empty string (no sources are displayed).
Default Sources=fstds_cctv

# Output Path is a required string, specifying the location at which recordings
# will be stored.
# For VADAAR-based systems this must match the path used by the DVR.
Output Path=\\172.17.102.3\SessionData\VADAAR\

# !! THE FOLLOWING OPTION IS CURRENTLY UNSUPPORTED !!
# Enabled Recording is an optional boolean value (0 or 1), offering global
# control over recording. If unspecified, the default is 1 (recording is
# enabled).
Enable Recording=1

# Delete Old Media on Start is an optional boolean value (0 or 1). A value of
# 1 indicates that when the module starts, it will delete any previously
# recorded media that doesn't relate to a saved session. If unspecified, the
# default is 0 (old media is retained).
#
# The module will do its best to only remove media it was responsible for
# creating, but has some difficulty when the module is hub associated. This
# can be avoided by specifying a value for the Unique Name property (defined
# above).
Delete Old Media on Start=0

# Media Sync Time is an optional floating point number, defining how many
# seconds the playback of media can "drift" before a synchronisation command
# is issued. If unspecified, the default is one second.
Media Sync Time=2.0

# Wait for Session Start is an optional boolean value (0 or 1) to tell the
# module if it should wait until a session starts before recording. A value of
# 0 matches the behaviour of the Video Camera module; recording starts
# as soon as a session begins to load. A value of 1 instead waits until the first
# transition from "paused" to "running". If unspecified, the default is 0.
Wait for Session Start=0


# This section defines the Replay Overlay, which is used to indicate that the
# media is part of a replay session (i.e. it's not live).
[Replay Overlay]
# !! ONLY PNG IMAGES ARE CURRENTLY SUPPORTED !!
# Specifies the file used for the replay overlay. Both absolute paths, and paths
# relative to the current working directory, are supported.
# If unspecified, the default is Images/Replay.png.
File Name=Images/Replay.png

# Set to non-zero to enable the replay overlay.
# If unspecified, the default is 1.
Enabled=1

# An optional parameter for controlling the flashing period. Defines how long,
# in seconds, the overlay will be visible for.
# Optional. If unspecified, the default is 1.0.
On Period=1.0

# An optional parameter for controlling the flashing period. Defines how long,
# in seconds, the overlay will be hidden for.
# Optional. If unspecified, the default is 1.0.
Off Period=1.0


# As above, except for the recording overlay.

# This section specifies how the module will interact with VADAAR.
[VADAAR]
# Central Control URL is an optional string, specifying the URL of the
# VADAAR Central Control component. It is the same URL that would be used in
# an internet browser to inspect and control the system. If unspecified, the
# default is http://localhost:80
Central Control URL=http://172.17.102.1:80


# The module will search for all sections beginning with VADAARSource; as
# long as the sections are named uniquely, they will form the configuration
# for each VADAAR video source the module knows about.
[VADAARSource 1]
# Unique Name is a required string, defining the unique value that the module
# uses to identify a media source. If two sources share the same Unique Name,
# behaviour is undefined. If unspecified, this source will be ignored.
Unique Name=fstds_cctv

# Recorded is an optional boolean value (0 or 1). A value of 1 indicates that
# this source should be recorded, otherwise the source is only available for
# viewing during a live session. If unspecified, the default is 1 (the source
# is recorded).
Recorded=1

# Sender Name is a required string, specifying the VADAAR sender this source
# comes from. The list of senders can be found by navigating to the Central
# Control URL/settings (e.g http://localhost:80/settings) and inspecting the
# known capture services. Typically, it is the name of the PC the Sender is
# running on. If unspecified, this source will be ignored.
Sender Name=MMRBEM-FC-DB-PROXY

# Session Name is a required string, specifying the stream to use from the
# VADAAR sender (a sender may output more than one stream). These are specified
# in the JSON configuration for the Sender itself; for example, the default
# VADAAR configuration includes a video-full session, which captures the desktop
# of the PC the sender is running on. If unspecified, this source will be
# ignored.
Session Name=fstds_cctv
