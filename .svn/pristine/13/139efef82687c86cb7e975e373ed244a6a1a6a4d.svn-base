# GMI Behaviour

# Set to true to treat a mouse entering a hotspot as a press,
# as a workaround for touchscreen driver behaviour.

#
#################   This flag should not be used in most cases   #################
# Where possible, applications should use TouchCaptureWindows instead of setting this flag.
# Core applications have properties of the form xxx.touchcapture.enable
# for enhanced touchscreen compatibility.
#
#
# Some touchscreen drivers (such as the Windows 7 stock driver)
# do not report a mouse press until some other action has occurred (move or release).
# This will result in momentary controls not responding if the user presses 
# the screen without moving their finger.
#
# Typically, even dodgy drivers move the mouse pointer immediately; only the press is suppressed.
# This flag tells the GMI to listen for such events.
# If the pointer does not move with the initial touch, this flag will not help you.
#
# Note that this solution does not respond correctly to the user pressing on the same location twice in a row.
# This should be relatively difficult to do on high-PPI screens;
# if you are using a low-PPI screen, be sure to test the behaviour of momentary controls.
#
# The preferred solution is to use a better driver, if one can be found.
# http://www.touch-base.com/ has a driver which covers most touchscreens.
#
# No matter which driver is used you should switch off funky options.
# This is usually things like:
# - flick gestures
# - long press gets reinterpreted as a right click

# Label configuration

# Set to true to see debugging output - MUST BE FALSE ON A DEPLOYED SIM!

# Sets the maximum width of a label before wrapping is required.
# By default they are limited to 1/3 of the screen width. Usually that will be sufficient.
